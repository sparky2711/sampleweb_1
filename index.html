          Gaming PCs, particularly powerful, may cost more than consoles, but PCs have uncompetitive flexibility, modality and power. As a result, PC gaming can quickly move both in and out of trends to bring unique and wonderful experiences to its
          gamers. A warning: unlike our previous Essentials lists, we have a multi-development library focusing on the 22 playing games, which everyone thinks should play to make the best of PC gaming. So, a warning first-hand: Some of our personal
          favourites are included, but also older games which cast a long shadow.Why, though, 22 games? Everything less makes it difficult to narrow things down and could be overwhelming. 22 games represent a decent amount of titles, split over
          several genres, with choices for every age group or so. And we have a link for each game, if possible, to our guide in case you need some help to start.
          This list also evolves constantly. We included the games that were cycled out for a little further inspiration at the bottom.
          Let's just dig in!
